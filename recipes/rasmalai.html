    <p>Ras Malai is cheese dumplings in cream sauce. This is a popular Indian dessert and takes a long time to prepare the traditional way. I came up with some shortcuts and ended up with this recipe which tastes exactly the same as traditional Ras Malai.</p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups half and half</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon rose water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped blanched almonds</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>   
    </ul>
    <strong>Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
       <li>Blend the ricotta cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl with a hand mixer; divide the mixture between 12 muffin cups.</li>
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Arrange the cheese balls onto a dessert platter.</li>
       <li>While the cheese bakes, pour the half and half into a saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat; simmer 10 minutes. Stir 1 cup sugar, the cardamom, rose water, and saffron into the half and half and simmer another 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Drizzle the cooled mixture over the cheese balls. Sprinkle the almonds and pistachios over the cheese balls to serve.</li>

    </ol>
